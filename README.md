project from website: https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/create-a-contact-form-b2n9ltrdy1

Introduction

A form often needs to be used to pass data to various other applications. In many cases, it could be a database, in others, it may be to give a specific answer or a quote. Regardless of how the information may need to be used, it is an important skill to be able to move data to new pages so it can be manipulated for use in further code. For this project, you will create a HTML web form.
Requirements

The form should consist of:

    A text input for user’s name
    A text input for user’s email address
    A drop down to select user’s issue (Query, Feedback, Complaint, Other)
    A text area for user’s comment
    The form will post to a second page which will display the information in an easy to read format.
